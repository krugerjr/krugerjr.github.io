	        <h3>NFL Football Predictions</h3>
	        <p>I believe that the best team in the American Football Conference or AFC is the New England Patriots. New England’s offense this year reminds me a little of the 2007 season when they went undefeated. They have same quarterback, which is Tom Brady. But unlike 2007, when their three best players were Wes Welker, Randy Moss, and Donte’ Stallworth, who are all wide receivers, this year their three best players play different positions which makes them more balanced. Rob Gronkowski is a tight end, Julian Edelman is a wide receiver, and Dion Lewis is a running back. These similarities make me think that the New England Patriots will beat the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship.</p>

	        <p>I feel that the best team in the National Football Conference or NFC is the Seattle Seahawks. During the offseason, Seattle was pretty much able to resign all their main players the last two years when they made the Super Bowl. The key difference between the last two years and this year is that this year they signed Jimmy Graham, who is one of the best tight ends in the NFL this year, and that happens to be the position that Seattle utilized the least in the past two years. This is why I think that the Seattle Seahawks will beat the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship. I think Super Bowl 50 will come down to the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks, and the Seahawks will win.</p>
