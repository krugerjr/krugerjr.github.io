	        <h3>NFL Football Predictions</h3>
	        <p>I believe that the best team in the American Football Conference or AFC is the New England Patriots. New England’s offense this year reminds me a little of the 2007 season when they went undefeated. They have the same quarterback, which is Tom Brady. But unlike 2007, when their three best players were Wes Welker, Randy Moss, and Donte’ Stallworth, who were all wide receivers, this year their three best players play different positions which I think makes them a more balanced team. Rob Gronkowski is a tight end who has 540 receiving yards and 4 touchdowns this season, Julian Edelman is a wide receiver with 617 receiving yards and 2 touchdowns, and LeGarrette Blount is a running back who has 12 of the 13 rushing touchdowns this season for the Patriots. The only downfall I can see for the Patriots is that Rob Gronkowski is out for the season, but because of these similarities, I think that the New England Patriots will beat the Oakland Raiders in the AFC Championship.</p>

	        <p>I feel that the best team in the National Football Conference or NFC is the Dallas Cowboys. Dallas ended up drafting two of the best rookies in the NFL this season, who are Dak Prescott who is their starting quarterback and Ezekiel Elliott who is one of their starting running backs. This is why I think that the Dallas Cowboys will beat the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship. I think Super Bowl 51 will come down to the New England Patriots and the Dallas Cowboys, with the Patriots winning by a touchdown.</p>
