	        <h3>MLB Baseball Predictions</h3>
	        <p>I think the five best teams in the American league are the Toronto Blue Jays, Kansas City Royals, New York Yankees, Houston Astros, and Texas Rangers. At the beginning of this season, I thought for sure, that Kansas City was going to be the best team in the American League because they had great hitting and pitching, plus there were problems with the other four teams. For example, Toronto needed better pitching, New York had a really old team, Houston didn’t have enough good hitting and pitching, and Texas need better pitching. Kansas City was also the only team out of these 5 that I saw being a top five team. By the end of the season, each one of those teams got what they needed. In the end, I predict that the Toronto Blue Jays will win the American League by beating the Kansas City Royals in seven games.</p>

	        <p>I believe that the five best teams in the National league are the St Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Mets, and Chicago Cubs. St Louis definitely has the most balanced team in the National League because each of the other four teams have one aspect of baseball that they’re better at than any of the other baseball aspects. For example, Los Angeles has better pitching than hitting, Pittsburgh has better hitting, New York has better pitching, and Chicago also has better pitching.  I think that the St Louis Cardinals will beat the Pittsburgh Pirates in six games, to go to the World Series.</p>

	        	<h3>World Series Predictions</h3>
	        	<p>My prediction is that the World Series will be the Toronto Blue Jays vs. the St Louis Cardinals, and the Blue Jays will win it in 7 games. St Louis maybe the better team, but the better team doesn’t always win, and I think it will come down to who’s on a bigger hot streak. Right now Toronto is clearly on an absolutely incredible hot streak. For example, since the all-star break, after acquiring David Price who is an all-star pitcher, and Troy Tulowitzki who is an all-star shortstop, Toronto’s win-loss record is 42 and 19. They lead in a few of the MLB team statistics, including most runs scored which is 833 and run differential which is the total number of runs you score minus the total number of runs you allow, which Toronto has a run differential of 217 and the next closest to them is St Louis with 124. Toronto has a top 5 player in each of the main player statistics except for batting averages and saves.</p>
