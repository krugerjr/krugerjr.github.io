	        <h3>MLB Baseball Predictions</h3>
	        <p>I believe the five best teams in the American league during the 2017-2018 MLB season will be the Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, Toronto Blue Jays, New York Yankees, and Texas Rangers. I think that Boston will be the best team in the American League because they are the most balanced team with great hitters including Mookie Betts and Dustin Pedroia, both with a batting average of 318 last season, and great pitchers including Rick Porcello who had a win-loss record of 22-4 last season and David Price who had 228 strikeouts last season. Plus I can see there being potential problems for the other four teams because they aren't as balanced. Boston is also the only American League team I see being a top five team overall. In the end, I predict that the Boston Red Sox will win the American League by beating the Toronto Blue Jays in six games.</p>

	        <p>I think the five best teams in the National league during the 2017-2018 MLB season will end up being the St Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco Giants, New York Mets, and Chicago Cubs. Chicago definitely has the most balanced team in the National League and in the MLB overall, with a perfect balance of hitting and pitching. Chicago's starting pitchers include Jake Arrieta, Jon Lester, Kyle Hendricks, and John Lackey, they have a combined ERA of 2.75 and a win-loss record of 64-29, plus they have Aroldis Chapman who is one of the best closing pitchers in baseball right now. Chicago's starting hitters had a combined batting average of 256, 767 RBIs, and 199 home runs last season. This is why I think that the Chicago CUbs will beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games, to go to the World Series.</p>

	        	<h3>World Series Predictions</h3>
	        	<p>My prediction is that the World Series will be the Boston Red Sox vs. the Chicago Cubs, with the Cubs winning it in 7 games. I believe the deciding factors in the World Series will be who wants it more and which team is on a hotter streak. Clearly the Chicago Cubs are on a hotter streak, having won the World Series for the first time in 108 years last season.</p>
