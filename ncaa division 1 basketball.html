	        <h3>NCAA Division 1 Basketball Predictions</h3>
	        <p>These are the teams that I believe will win the power 5 conferences which are the ACC, SEC, Big 10, Big 12, and Pac 12. I think the Duke Blue Devils will win the ACC tournament by beating the North Carolina Tar Heels since UNC lost its two best players from last season who were Bryce Johnson and Marcus Paige, as opposed to Duke who still has two of their best starters from last season with Luke Kennard and Grayson Allen. The Kansas Jayhawks will win the Big 12 regular season and Big 12 tournament by beating the West Virginia Mountaineers. Even though Kansas lost it's two best starters from last season, those two starters are being replaced by Carlton Bragg who was a top 25 recruit in 2015 and Josh Jackson who was the number two recruit in 2016. I believe that the Indiana Hoosiers will win the Big 10 regular season, but will get upset by the Wisconsin Badgers in the Big 10 tournament Championship. Even though Indiana's starters are averaging 73 points combined, Wisconsin has all five of their starters back from last season and are lead by four seniors. I believe that the Arizona Wildcats will win the Pac 12 tournament by beating the Oregon Ducks. The UK Wildcats are still the best team in the SEC and will win the SEC tournament by beating the Auburn Tigers. I think the Final Four teams will be Duke, UK, IU, and UNC, and Duke will win the NCAA tournament by beating UK.</p>
