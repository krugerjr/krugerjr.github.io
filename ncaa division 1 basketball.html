	        <h3>NCAA Division 1 Basketball Predictions</h3>
	        <p>These are the teams that I believe will win the power 5 conferences. I think the UNC Tar Heels will win the ACC tournament by beating the Duke Blue Devils because UNC has its two best players from last season who are Bryce Johnson and Marcus Paige, plus 4 of Dukeâ€™s 5 starters from last season went to the NBA. Even though the Kansas Jayhawks will win the Big 12 regular season, I think the Iowa State Cyclones will win the Big 12 championship by getting the upset win over Kansas because Iowa State still has Georges Niang who is one of the best big men in college basketball. The Maryland Terrapins will win the Big 10 tournament by beating the Michigan State Spartans because Maryland still has Melo Trimble who was their second best player last season and they picked up Rasheed Sulaimon who is a top transfer from Duke. I believe that the Arizona Wildcats will win the Pac 12 tournament by beating the UCLA Bruins. The UK Wildcats are still the best team in the SEC and will win the SEC tournament by beating LSU Tigers. I think the Final Four will be a rematch between Duke and UNC, and the other game will be Maryland vs. Louisville, and UNC will beat Maryland in the NCAA finals.</p>
