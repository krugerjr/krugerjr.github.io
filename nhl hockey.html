          <h3>NHL Hockey Predictions</h3>
          <p>I predict that these teams will be the top 8 teams in the Eastern Conference: the Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers, Pittsburgh Penguins, Tampa Bay Lightning, Washington Capitals, Boston Bruins, Columbus Blue Jackets, and New Jersey Devils. The Chicago Blackhawks, St Louis Blues, Los Angeles Kings, Anaheim Ducks, Edmonton Oilers, Winnipeg Jets, Minnesota Wild, and San Jose Sharks, I believe are the top 8 teams in the Western Conference. I believe the Montreal Canadiens will beat the Washington Capitals in 7 games to win the Eastern Conference in order to go to the Stanley Cup Championship. Even though the Chicago Blackhawks and the St Louis Blues are the two best Western Conference teams, both are in the Central Division, so they can't play each other in the Western Conference championship. This is why I think the Chicago Blackhawks will beat the Los Angeles Kings in 6 games, and then go on to win the Stanley Cup by upsetting the Montreal Canadiens in 7 games.</p>

          <h3>NHL Hockey Award Predictions</h3>
          <p>I think the top 5 trophies in the NHL are the Hart Memorial Trophy, Vezina Trophy, Calder Memorial Trophy, Art Ross Trophy, and the Maurice Rocket Richard Trophy. The Hart Memorial Trophy is for the league MVP, the Vezina Trophy is for the top goaltender, the Calder Memorial Trophy is for the most outstanding rookie, the Art Ross trophy is for the player with the most regular season points, and the Maurice Rocket Richard Trophy is for the player with the most regular season goals. I think Patrick Kane who plays for Chicago will win the Hart Memorial Trophy by beating out Alexander Ovechkin who plays for Washington. Tuukka Rask, goalie for Boston will beat Carey Price, goalie for Montreal, in order to win the Vezina Trophy. I think that the Calder Memorial Trophy will be awarded to Auston Matthews who plays for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Matthews was the first rookie to score 4 goals in his debut. Mark Scheifele who plays for Winnipeg has 23 points in 21 games, and is projected to have 90 points this season, according to ESPN, which is why I think he will win the Art Ross Trophy. I think the Maurice Rocket Richard Trophy will be awarded to Marian Hossa who plays for Chicago and has scored 510 goals in his 18 year career so far.</p>
