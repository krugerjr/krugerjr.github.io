	        <h3>NCAA FBS Division 1 Football Predictions</h3>
	        <p>These are the teams that I think will win the power 5 conferences. Even though the two best teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference or ACC are the Florida State Seminoles and the Clemson Tigers, they are in the same division of the ACC so they both can’t win it. This is why I think the Florida State Seminoles will win ACC Championship by beating the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Since the Big-12 Conference doesn’t have a conference championship, I think that the Baylor Bears will win the Big-12 by getting an upset win over the TCU Horned Frogs because Baylor has an overall better offense. The two best teams in the Big-10 Conference are the Michigan State Spartans and the Ohio State Buckeyes, but because they are in the same division of the Big-10, they both can’t go to the Big-10 championship. This is why I feel that Ohio State will win the Big-10 championship by beating the Wisconsin Badgers. The Utah Utes will win the Pacific 12 Conference Championship or Pac-12 championship by beating the UCLA Bruins. I believe that the Ole Miss Rebels will win the Southeastern Conference or SEC by beating the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC championship.</p>

	        	<h3>College Football Playoff Predictions</h3>
	        	<p>I think the college football playoffs will be Ohio State vs. Utah, and Ole Miss vs. Baylor, and Ohio State will win the National Championship by beating Ole Miss. Ohio State has four of the best players in college football right now, including Ezekiel Elliott, Cardale Jones, JT Barrett, and Braxton Miller. Plus three of those four players are All-American quarterbacks.</p>

	        	<h3>Heisman Trophy Predictions</h3>
	        	<p>One of the highest individual achievements you can win in college football is the Heisman trophy. My early top 5 Heisman trophy candidate picks are Jake Browning, Nick Chubb, Derrick Henry, Connor Cook, and Leonard Fournette. Jake Browning is the starting quarterback for the Washington Huskies, and in high school, he accounted for more touchdowns than any other teenage quarterback in the US ever with 223 touchdowns. Nick Chubb is the starting running back for the Georgia Bulldogs, in 3 games so far, he has ran for 468 yards with 4 touchdowns. Derrick Henry is the starting running back for the Alabama Crimson Tide, in 3 games this season, he has ran for 370 yards and 7 touchdowns. Conner Cook is the starting quarterback for the Michigan State Spartans, over his starting career he has a win-loss record of 23-3. Leonard Fournette is a running back for the LSU Tigers, in four games, he has 631 rushing yards and 8 touchdowns. I think Leonard Fournette will win the Heisman trophy.</p>
