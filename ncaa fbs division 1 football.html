	        <h3>NCAA FBS Division 1 Football Predictions</h3>
	        <p>These are the teams that I think will win the power 5 conferences. Even though the two best teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference or ACC are the Louisville Cardinals and the Clemson Tigers, they are both in the Atlantic division of the ACC so they both canâ€™t win it, plus Clemson already beat Louisville. This is why I think the Clemson Tigers will win ACC Championship by beating the North Carolina Tar Heels. I think that the Oklahoma Sooners will win the Big 12 by beating the Oklahoma State Cowboys. The two best teams in the Big 10 Conference are the Michigan Wolverines and the Ohio State Buckeyes. But both of them are in the East division of the Big 10, so I think Michigan will get the upset win at Ohio State and go to the Big 10 championship and win it by beating the Wisconsin Badgers. Even though the Washington State Cougars are undefeated in the Pac 12, and have won 8 games in a row, I think the Washington Huskies will win the Pac 12 North division and then win the Pac 12 championship by beating the Colorado Buffaloes, winners of the Pac 12 South divison. I believe that the Alabama Crimson Tide will win the Southeastern Conference or SEC by beating the Florida Gators in the SEC championship.</p>

	        	<h3>College Football Playoff Predictions</h3>
	        	<p>I think the college football playoffs will be Alabama vs. Washington, and Michigan vs. Clemson, and Alabama will win the National Championship by beating Clemson. I believe Alabama will win the National Championship because they have beaten six ranked opponents, are undefeated, and the closest anyone has gotten to beating them is Ole Miss by 4 points.</p>

	        	<h3>Heisman Trophy Predictions</h3>
	        	<p>One of the highest individual achievements you can win in college football is the Heisman trophy. My top 5 Heisman trophy candidate picks are Dede Westbrook, Lamar Jackson, Donnel Pumphrey, Jalen Hurts, and Deshaun Watson. Dede Westbrook is a starting wide receiver for the Oklahoma Sooners, and this season, he is tied for fourth in most receiving yards this season with 1254 yards and 14 touchdowns, and has caught 68 passes. Donnel Pumphrey is a starting running back for the San Diego State Aztecs, who leads the NCAA in rushing yards this season with 1779. Jalen Hurts is the starting quarterback for the Alabama Crimson Tide, this season, he has thrown 16 touchdowns and ran for 11 touchdowns. Deshaun Watson is the starting quarterback for the Clemson Tigers, during his 3 year NCAA career he has 8647 passing yards with 76 passing touchdowns, and 1683 rushing yards with 19 rushing touchdowns. Lamar Jackson is the starting quarterback for the Louisville Cardinals, this season he has a total of 47 touchdowns with 28 passing and 19 rushing, he is also responsible for 4476 total yards with 3109 passing and 1367 rushing yards. This is why I think Lamar Jackson will win the Heisman trophy in 2016.</p>
