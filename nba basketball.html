	        <h3>NBA Basketball Predictions</h3>
	        <p>I think the best team in the Eastern Conference is going to be the Cleveland Cavaliers. Cleveland will be the number 1 seed because they have three of the most talented players in the NBA right now, with Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love who combined for an average of 63.4 points a game. In the offseason, they picked up Mo Williams who can give them some added scoring depth that they didn’t have last season. The Cleveland Cavaliers will win the Eastern Conference by beating the Chicago Bulls in six games.</p>

	        <p>I think the best team in the Western Conference is the San Antonio Spurs. San Antonio will be the best team in the Western Conference because they have one of the oldest and most well known big 3’s in the NBA right now, with Tony Parker, Tim Duncan, and Manu Ginobili, who have won three NBA championships together. They also signed Lamarcus Aldridge and resigned Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard who will be the three all-stars who replace San Antonio’s big 3 when they retire. I think that the San Antonio Spurs will beat the Golden State Warriors in seven games to win the Western Conference.</p>

	        <p>I predict that the 2016 NBA championship will come down to the Cleveland Cavaliers playing the San Antonio Spurs, with the Spurs winning it in 7 games. Even though Cleveland’s big 3 is younger and in their prime, San Antonio’s big 3 has more experience. Plus San Antonio has a better overall team. But I think the difference will come down to the 3 next best players. For the San Antonio Spurs, they are Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, and Lamarcus Alridge, who are averaging 51.6 points combined vs. Mo Williams, Timofey Mozgov, and Anderson Varejao, who are averaging only 33.7 points combined.</p>
