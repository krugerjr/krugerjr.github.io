	        <h3>NBA Basketball Predictions</h3>
	        <p>I think the Eastern Conference Finals will come down to the Cleveland Cavaliers vs the Chicago Bulls. Cleveland will be the number 1 seed because they have three of the most experienced veteran players in the NBA right now, with Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love who combined for an average of 60.9 points per game last season. Those three also averaged a combined 66.2 points per game in last years playoffs when they won the NBA Championship. I predict that the Cleveland Cavaliers will win the Eastern Conference by beating the Chicago Bulls in six games.</p>

	        <p>I think the San Antonio Spurs will play the Golden State Warriors for the Western Conference Championship. Golden State will be the best team in the Western Conference because they have one of the most talented young big 3’s in the NBA right now, with Draymond Green, Stephen Curry, and Klay Thompson. Together they helped Golden State break the all time regular season win-loss record with 73-9. They also signed Kevin Durant who is 7 time all star and has averaged 27.4 points a game during his career. I think that the Golden State Warrios will beat the San Antonio Spurs in seven games to win the Western Conference.</p>

	        <p>I predict that the 2016 NBA championship will come down to the Cleveland Cavaliers playing the Golden State Warriors, with the Cavaliers winning it in 7 games. Even though Golden State has a more talented starting five, Cleveland’s starting five has won an NBA Championship together and has more experience playing together. I think the difference will come down to how well each team's players play together. For the Golden State Warriors, each of their starters can the main player on another team, so they have to figure out who will be their main leader that can hit the game winning shot at the end. Cleveland has already shown that they can play as team, when they won the NBA Championship last year.</p>
